  MobaTools V1.1
   (C) 09-2019 fpm fpm@mnet-online.de
   
  History:
  V1.1.4 09-2019
      - speed = 0 is not allowsed( it is set to 1 internally )
	  - fix error when repeatedly setting target position very fast
	  - allow higher steprates up to 2500 steps/sec.
	    ( relative jitter increases with higher rates, abs. jitter is 200Âµs )
	  - typo corrected in MoToBase.h 
  V1.1.3 08-2019
      - no more warnings when compiling
      - fix error (overflow) when converting angle to steps
      - fix error when converting angle to microseconds in servo class
      - reworked softleds. Risetimes unitl 10 sec are possible.
  V1.1.2 08-2019
      - fix error when only servo objects are defined ( sketch crashed )
      - two more stepper examples ( thanks to 'agmue' from german arduino.cc forum )
      - detach() configures used pins back to INPUT
  V1.1 06-2019
      - stepper now supports ramps (accelerating, decelerating )
      - stepper speed has better resolution with high steprates
      - split source into several fuction-specific .cpp files. This
        saves flash space if only part of the functionality is used.
  V1.0  11-2017 Use of Timer 3 if available ( on AtMega32u4 and AtMega2560 )
  V0.9  03-2017
        Better resolution for the 'speed' servo-paramter (programm starts in compatibility mode)
        outputs for softleds can be inverted
        MobaTools run on STM32F1 platform
        
  V0.8 02-2017
        Enable Softleds an all digital outputs
  V0.7 01-2017
		Allow nested Interrupts with the servos. This allows more precise other
        interrupts e.g. for NmraDCC Library.
		A4988 stepper driver IC is supported (needs only 2 ports: step and direction)
