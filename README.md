# Microcontroller-and-IoT-projects
projects based on microcontroller like Arduino, NodeMCU,, boards controller, variety of sensors, servos, and mechanics principles
IoT (internet of things).

# libraries
in this folder contains all of libraries of sensor, board and components that I am using in my projects. Basically, you can find it in internet or download it from IDE program like Arduino. 

-----------All my projects:-----------------------

# project 1 (IoT smart bird cage)
in this projects, I was making a bird cage that has controller and data transmiting through Internet of Things. I am using ESP32 NodeMCU v4 board, 2 sg90 servos, 2 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, 1 waterlevel sensor, and Light sensor. This cage can control and monitoring feed and water level for the bird inside.

# project 2 (Temperature and Humidity monitoring for Swallow Bird cage)
in this project, I was making of swallow bird cage that has monitoring system for temperature and humidity inside the cage. Monitoring data sending through Internet of Things.
